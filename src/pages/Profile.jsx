     I’ve spent over a decade leading design and construction projects in London — at iconic venues such as the British Library, 
     the Natural History Museum, and the Royal Opera House — and I’m now pivoting my career in Spain to focus on what I enjoy most: 
     digital products and tech projects. A bit more about me: I studied Architecture at the Universitat Politècnica de València and 
     specialised in managing cultural/educational projects and historic-heritage restoration. I’ve always loved working in teams and coordinating people. 
     My career took me to the UK years ago, where I became a PRINCE2 Practitioner, and more recently a Scrum Master and ITIL 4 Practitioner. 
     I recently completed the Full-Stack Development bootcamp at The Bridge, where I learned technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js; 
     databases like MongoDB and SQL; and tools like GitHub. I’ve discovered a genuine passion for programming and would love to put what I’ve learned into practice 
     by joining a technical team.
